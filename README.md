# Password_Generator

# Description on the project

This is a project that operates within a web browser and has a responsive and user-friendly interface. The main function of the project is to generate a random password, which is triggered by clicking on the 'Generate Password' button.
The user will be prompted to provide specific criteria for the password, such as length and character types. The password must be between 10 and 64 characters long and include at least one type of character from lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.
If the user's input doesn't meet the criteria, the browser window will continue to request information until valid criteria are entered. The button can be used to generate multiple passwords.
